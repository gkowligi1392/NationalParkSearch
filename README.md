# Endless Trails
National Park Search Tool

## Elevator Pitch
* Who Are We?
  * We are a diverse group of programmers who really enjoy traveling, seeing sights, and spending time in the beautiful outdoors.
* What Did We Do?
 * Our goal was to make a resource that fellow travelers can use to look for national parks near their home city or a city they will be visiting soon.
* How Did We Do It and What Is New?
 * Using the National Parks Service and Google Predictions APIs, a drop-down list of potential city choices will appear as the user types the first few letters of a city name.  When they choose a city and a distance, all national parks near that city will be listed, along with a picture, some information about the park, and a few thumbnails of images related to that park.

User stories,
* AS A lover of travel
* WE WANT a tool to let anyone search for national parks

The Elevator pitch, Do you really enjoy traveling, seeing sights and the beutiful outdoors. So our goal is to have a website that fellow travelers can use on a day trip (or longer) if your is looking for national parks thats close by or on the way to your next adventure.

The Concept, We understand that not everyone has time to go all the way to the concierge, or talk to the front desk, or do a deep search on google so we wanted to make it easy for people who travel to get the information they needed. With the simple push of a few buttons.

Our future development ideas are, first we would like to turn this into a mobile app. Extend to state and/or local parks. A more enhanced UI experience. We would also like to have a check-in/stickerbadge system for the most adventurous travelers. A lot more optoins to search for specfic activities. And theres much more room for even more improvements.
